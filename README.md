# Spotify Listening Data Analysis (2013–2025)

This project analyzes over a decade of my personal Spotify listening history, uncovering patterns in how my music preferences and habits have evolved over time. Built in Power BI, the dashboard is based on actual streaming activity from my account and is designed to highlight when, how, and what I listen to most.

## Data Source

- Spotify streaming history from 2013 to 2025  
- *Note: 2014 and 2015 are omitted due to inactivity during those years*

## Project Description

While this project isn’t built for a business context, it applies core data analysis principles to real-world personal data. The goal was to:
- Practice data cleaning, transformation, and visualization
- Gain insight into my own music consumption over time
- Build a self-explanatory, interactive dashboard in Power BI

The final dashboard helps visualize listening habits by year, platform, and artist, and allows users to explore patterns in streaming behavior over time.

## Questions Explored

- Who are my top 10 most-listened-to artists?
- What are my top 10 most-played songs?
- Which years had the most listening activity?
- What are my top 5 songs for each year?
- Which platform do I use the most to stream music?
- How much of my listening was done while offline?

## Reflection

This project helped me practice end-to-end data analysis: from cleaning messy timestamps across time zones to building clear, interactive visuals with context-aware metrics. While it's based on personal data, the techniques and structure are directly applicable to user analytics, engagement modeling, and behavior-driven storytelling.
